#Raspberry Git
Here I am just getting my feet wet with raspberry pi starting with
 testing git.
I will try to include a file of all the stuff I learned here. For example,
nano filename.txt
-this creates a file and open the editor nano
Crtl - x
-once in nano this opens the save prompt and allows you to save your file
